# 🏥 Bodo / Booking Dokter : Hospital Queue & Medical Record Management System


[![Windows](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Windows-0078D6?logo=windows11&logoColor=white)](#)


**Bodo** or *"Booking Dokter"* is a C++ application that efficiently manages patient queues and medical records using **Queue** and **AVL Tree** data structures. It offers a full suite of features, including CRUD operations, fast search, undo functionality, and optional file saving. Designed with an interactive CLI, Bodo serves as a practical example of applying data structures in real-world scenarios.

**NOTE :**

 ```Bodo can only be used on windows```

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

### Queue

- **Purpose**: Manages the sequence of patients waiting for services.
- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, IsEmpty.

### AVL Tree

- **Purpose**: Stores and manages patient medical records with balanced tree properties.
- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search, In-order Traversal.

*Using AVL Trees ensures that search operations remain efficient even as the dataset grows.*
